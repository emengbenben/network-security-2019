1.  Introduction

   The Golden Nugget Casino PRFC defines the client-server framework
   that will used by our company to receive the right data fields and
   also send the right fields to the users.  It defines how the
   regisyration, login and game playing packets will be sent to and fro.

   This document describes the packets and each of its fields along with
   their right data types.


2.  Functional Specifications

2.1.  New User Packet

   The new user packet definws the fields that are required for
   registering a user who is not previously registered.  Already
   registered users will not be able to register and password, username
   and emails checks will be done here.

   class NewUser(PacketType): DEFINITION_IDENTIFIER =
   "NuggetFramework.type" DEFINITION_VERSION = "1.0" Body = [ ("Email",
   STRING), ("Pwd", STRING), ("Conf_Pwd", STRING), ("Company_Name",
   STRING), ("Addr", STRING) ]

   NewUser: Email: This is the email address used for registering.  A
   check will be done as to whether it is a legitimate email address or
   not using the syntax- abc@jhu.edu where '@jhu.edu' is mandatory and a
   check on the JHu email ID will be done.  Pwd: The password needs to
   have atleast 6 characters containing both characters and numbers
   (atleast 1 character and 1 number).  This will be stored as a hash
   value.

2.2.  Transaction

   Transaction:

   class Transaction(PacketType): DEFINITION_IDENTIFIER =
   "NuggetFramework.type" DEFINITION_VERSION = "1.0" Body = [ ("Token",
   STRING), ("Bet", STRING), ("GameID", STRING) ]

2.3.  Registered User

   The Registered user packet definws the fields that are required for a
   user who is not previously registered.  Already registered users will
   not be able to register and password, username and emails checks will
   be done here
