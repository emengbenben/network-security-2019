   <abstract>
     <t>Post-Interstellar Mining Protocol (PIMP) is a proposed transport layer 
       protocol that provides communucation reliabily on the Playground environment.
       PIMP is a simplified, TCP-like protocol. PIMP simplifies the protocol by making
       it packet based instead of bit based. Secondly, PIMP standardizes the window
       size, so it does not need to be included in the packet. Last, PIMP reduces
       network traffic by simply requesting retransmission of missing or corrupted
       packets, instead of ACKing each individual packet.ts, instead of ACKing each individual packet.</t>

   <section title="Preface">
     <t>This document describes Network Security Spring 2019
     Transmission Control Protocol. It draws heavily from DoD's
     1981 Transmission Control Protocol RFC. It both modifies
     and simplifies the original specification with an aim to
     reduce network congestion.</t>

     <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
       document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
       target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
     </section>
   </section>
   
   <section title="Motivation">
     <t>For applications running in the Playground environment to reliably 
      communicate, there needs to be a transport layer protocol that facilitates 
     traffic.</t>
     
     <t>In order to simplify the protocol and reduce network congestion,
     the PIMP window is set to a standard size (the maximum size allowed by
     a two bit number - 65,535 - which is the largest number that can
     be put in the two bit portion of the PIMP packet allocated to "window".</t>
     
     <t>In case of packet loss in extreme scenario, for example, client only sends one packet to server, but packet is lost, both server and client wait for the response from the other side. The ACK mechanism is needed.</t>

     <t>When server receives packer, it will place packets orderly, then it checks the sequence number of packet to determine if the packet is what it is supposed to receive. Once the packet is accepted by the server, it sends back a ACK packet.</t>

     <t>On the other side, after sending out the packet, the client will keep the data until it receives a corresponding ACK packet whose ACK number should be sequence number +1. It keeps waiting for 10 seconds. After timeout, it will resend the packets starting from time out packet. Within the 10 seconds, it will only be regarded as latency of network.</t>

     <t>Additionally, out of extreme scenario, the protocol is simplified by sending back a retransmission request packet for every missing sequence number after the window has been filled. The window is identified as "filled" after a specified timeout, and 
     at this time, the retransmit requests will be sent. In this case, only the specific packets will be needed for retransmission.</t>
     
     <t>If the sender receives a retransmission request, it should send out
     the missing packets sequentially. If the retransmission is not received, 
     the receiver will continue sending out retransmission request packets
     until the receiver actively closes the connection.</t>
     
     <t>In this way, the network traffic is reduced by not having an ACK for
     each sequence number, but simply for each missing one, and an ACK for each 
     window when it is complete.</t>
     
     <t>We no longer need a data offset field since the options field has been
      removed, so the PIMP header will be of fixed length. Because the port 
      numbers will be fixed, these fields can also be excluded from the PIMP header.</t>
     
     <t>Finally, we guard against SYN flooding by having a time out. If
     nothing is received from a client within the timeout, the connection
     is closed. SYN flooding may briefly occur, but the TCB will be flushed
     of any connections that are not fully open each time the timeout elapses.</t>
    
    <section title="Reliability">
    <t>The prime directive to PIMP is reliability. In order for data
      to be reliably transmitted, sequence numbers are used. The sender
      must complete the sequence and retransmit missing packets before
      they are given a new window with the next set of sequence numbers.
      Packets may be lost on the network, and a mechanism for retransmission
      must be supplied. The sequence numbers prevent duplicates, verify all 
      sent data has been received, and provide a mechanism for identifying 
      missing segments. Checksums are provided to recognize corruption of data.
      Retransmission of corrupted or fragmented data can then be requested.</t>
    
    <t>Additional metadata includes the "References" and "Author's Address"
    sections. These elements MUST conform to RFC specifications.</t>

     <t>
      The "three-way handshake" is the procedure used to establish a connection. This procedure normally is initiated by one PIMP and responded to by another PIMP. The procedure also works if two PIMP simultaneously initiate the procedure. When simultaneous attempt occurs, each PIMP receives packet with the SYN flag set which carries no acknowledgment after it has sent a "SYN". Of course, the arrival of an old duplicate "SYN" segment can potentially make it appear, to the recipient, that a simultaneous connection initiation is in progress. Proper use of "reset" segments can disambiguate these cases.
      Several examples of connection initiation follow. Although these examples do not show connection synchronization using data-carrying segments, this is perfectly legitimate, so long as the receiving PIMP doesn't deliver the data to the user until it is clear the data is valid (i.e., the data must be buffered at the receiver until the connection reaches the ESTABLISHED state). The three-way handshake reduces the possibility of false connections. It is the implementation of a trade-off between memory and messages to provide information for this checking.
      The simplest three-way handshake is shown in figure 7 below. The figures should be interpreted in the following way. Each line is numbered for reference purposes. Right arrows (-->) indicate
      departure of a PIMP packet from PIMP A to PIMP B, or arrival of a packet at B from A. Left arrows, indicate the reverse. Ellipsis (...) indicates a segment which is still in the network (delayed). An "XXX" indicates a segment which is lost or rejected.
      Comments appear in parentheses. PIMP states represent the state AFTER the departure or arrival of the segment (whose contents are shown in the center of each line). Segment contents are shown in abbreviated form, with sequence number, and ACK field. Other fields such as window, addresses, lengths, and text have been left out in the interest of clarity.

        <t>
        The principle reason for the three-way handshake is to prevent old duplicate connection initiations from causing confusion. To deal with this, a special control message, reset, has been devised. If the receiving PIMP is in a non-synchronized state (i.e., SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED), it returns to LISTEN on receiving an acceptable reset. If the TCP is in one of the synchronized states it aborts the connection and informs its user. We discuss this later case under "half-open" connections below. </t>
        <t>
        HALF OPEN
        An established connection is said to be "half-open" if one of the PIMPs has closed or aborted the connection at its end without the knowledge of the other, or if the two ends of the connection have become desynchronized owing to a crash that resulted in loss of memory. Such connections will automatically become reset if an attempt is made to send data in either direction. However, half-open connections are expected to be unusual, and the recovery procedure is mildly involved.
        If at site A the connection no longer exists, then an attempt by the user at site B to send any data on it will result in the site B PIMP receiving a reset control message. Such a message indicates to the site B PIMP that something is wrong, and it is expected to abort the connection.
        Assume that two user processes A and B are communicating with one another when a crash occurs causing loss of memory to A's PIMP.
        Depending on the operating system supporting A's PIMP, it is likely that some error recovery mechanism exists. When the PIMP is up again, A is likely to start again from the beginning or from a recovery point. As a result, A will probably try to OPEN the connection again or try to SEND on the connection it believes open. In the latter case, it receives the error message "connection not open" from the local (A's) PIMP. In an attempt to establish the connection, A's PIMP will send a packet containing SYN. This scenario leads to the example shown in figure 10. After PIMP A crashes, the user attempts to re-open the connection. PIMP B, in the meantime, thinks the connection is open.

        </figure>
        <t>When the SYN arrives at line 3, PIMP B, being in a synchronized state and the incoming segment outside the window, responds with an acknowledgment indicating what sequence it next expects to hear (ACKFLAG = TRUE SEQ=100). PIMP A sees that this segment does not acknowledge anything it sent and, being unsynchronized, sends a reset (RST) because it has detected a half-open connection. PIMP B aborts at line 5. PIMP A will continue to try to establish the connection; the problem is now reduced to the basic 3-way handshake of figure 7.
        An interesting alternative case occurs when PIMP A crashes and PIMP B tries to send data on what it thinks is a synchronized connection.
        This is illustrated in figure 11. In this case, the data arriving at PIMP A from PIMP B (line 2) is unacceptable because no such connection exists, so PIMP A sends a RST. The RST is acceptable so PIMP B processes it and aborts the connection.</t>

<section title="ACK Specification">
    <t>Under normal data transformation, the active open is performed by the client sending a SYN to the server. The client set the segment’s sequence number to a random value A. Then when server successfully receives a SYN, in response, it replies with a SYN-ACK. The Ack number  is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e A+1. and the sequence number that the server chooses for the packet is another random number,B. Finally the client sends an ACK back to the server. The sequence number is set to the received acknowledgement value i.e. A+1, and the acknowledgement number is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. B+1. At this point, both the client and server have received and acknowledgment of the connection. And the connection is established.</t>

    <t>If the first SYN packet is lost, the timeout mechanism will be called on client side and it will automatically resend the SYN packet once the ack does not arrive within the set time. And if it tries several times, connection will terminate.</t>

    <t>If SYN-ACK packet sent by server or ACK packet sent by the client is lost, timeout mechanism on server side will do the same thing, which means server will actively resend out the SYN-ACK packet once the ack does not arrive within the time. And if it tries several times, connection will terminate.</t>

    <t>Ideally, in the data transmission process, the client would send out data packets with continuously increment sequence numbers (seqNum). If nothing goes wrong, after the server receives a packet with seqNum = i, the server would respond back an acknowledgment packet to the client with the acknowledgment number (ackNum) equals to i + 1.</t>

    <t>In the case that the server does not successfully receive data packets sent from the client, no associated acknowledgment packets will be sent back to the client. As a result, as long as the client keeps track of all the sent packets, if after a certain timeout the client still not receive the ACK for those packets, the client would consider those packets are lost, and thus re-transmit them to the server again.</t>

    <t>The connection termination procedure for a pimp session is shown as following:
    In the case the client initiates the termination, it sends a FIN. After receiving it, the server sends back a acknowledgement. The server waits for application process to close and then sends its FIN. After receiving it, the client sends back a acknowledgement. Then the server closes when receiving the ACK, and client waits until the ACK is received by the server then the client proceeds to the closed state. If any of the packet is lost during the transmission, the timeout function is applied.</t>

   <section title="PRFC Revision Process">
   <t>Once a PRFC is officially published by the PETF, it cannot be modified further
   for any reason. A new PRFC must be submitted that identifies the errors and 
   proposes to "update" or "supercede" the previous document.</t>
   
   <t>A PRFC MUST use the "update" reference if the changes do not result in an
   incompatible protocol and the old protocol is not shown to be insecure. 
   Changes to PRFC's that are "updates" include:</t>
   
   <t><list style="numbers">
    <t>Corrections to spelling, grammar, and other wording in the document</t>
    <t>Additional details about operations and operational considerations</t>
    <t>Additional parameters or interactions to the existing protocol</t>
   </list></t>
   
   <t>A PRFC MUST use the "supercede" reference if the changes result in an incompatible
   protocol OR if the previous protocol is demonstrated to be insecure.</t>
   
   <t>Approval from the PETF MUST be obtained if approval was required for the original
   PRFC.</t>
   
   <t>A PRFC submitted without PETF approval MUST be revised only by the same PLAYGROUND
   group that submitted the original.</t>

       <section title="Copyright Information">
    <t>The PLAYGROUND experiment is still new and has not yet developed
    a policy that has been reviewed by legal counsel. However, at present,
    the following text MUST be used in the PRFC's.</t>
    
    <t>The copyright notice on the front page of the PRFC should read:

   <t>Student authors MUST grant copyrights to SETH JAMES NIELSON. However,
   they may also retain copyrights for themselves and add their names to the
   copyright notice accordingly.</t>
   
   <t> The final page of the PRFC MUST include a section entitled 
   "Full Copyright Statement" that reads:</t>

   legal counsel.  Moreover, the academic institutions at which
   PLAYGROUND experiments take place may have additional or even
   conflicting copyright and intellectual property rules.  Accordingly,
   concerned parties may need to contact their own lawyer and/or
   resources at their institution to understand the rights and
   limitations associated with code donated to a PLAYGROUND experiment."</t>

   <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)

                     added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                     images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).
v06 2010-04-01 TT     Changed ipr attribute values to latest ones. Changed date to
                     year only, to be consistent with the comments. Updated the 
                     IANA guidelines reference from the I-D to the finished RFC.  

v1.1 Team Kronos Update Proposal pull request 2019-03-27 
	-Changed checksum to MD5 hash
	-Changed header fields to match descriptions, and changed checksum from INT to BUFFER
	-Added the packet transmission steps of the handshake (as they are defined in TCP) to the Technical Functionality
	-Added error handling for packets received with improper flag combinations (the packet is dropped)
